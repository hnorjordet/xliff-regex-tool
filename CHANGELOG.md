## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **Escaped HTML entities in tag protection** - Fixed critical bug where "Ignore Tags" didn't properly handle escaped tags
  - Frontend `getTagPattern()` now correctly matches single-escaped (`&lt;tag&gt;`) and double-escaped (`&amp;lt;tag&amp;gt;`) HTML entities
  - Backend `_extract_text_segments()` pattern was already fixed in 0.4.2, now frontend is synchronized
  - Prevents false matches inside escaped XML/HTML content when searching with tag protection enabled
  - Critical fix for MXLIFF files with heavily escaped tag structures

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-28

### Changed
- **Standalone distribution** - Application now bundles Python CLI as a compiled executable
  - No longer requires Python installation on user's system
  - Uses PyInstaller to create self-contained 14MB executable

  - Significantly improves portability and ease of distribution
  - Development mode still uses Python scripts for faster iteration

### Fixed
- **TU display in batch check** - Translation unit numbers now show as readable integers

  - Automatic conversion from 0-indexed to 1-indexed display format
- **Replacement preview in batch check** - Preview now shows actual replacement values
  - Previously showed template like `$1 $2`, now shows computed result like "000 eur"
  - Applies regex replacement to matched text to generate accurate preview
  - Helps verify replacements before applying them
- **Ignore tags with escaped HTML entities** - Fixed "Protect Tags" to properly ignore escaped tags
  - Now correctly ignores `&lt;tag&gt;` (single-escaped) and `&amp;lt;tag&amp;gt;` (double-escaped)
  - Prevents matches inside escaped XML/HTML content in complex XLIFF files
  - Handles HTML entities (`&quot;`, `&amp;`, etc.) within escaped tags
  - Particularly important for memoQ MQXLIFF files with heavily nested tag structures

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- **Batch replace capture groups** - Fixed replacement strings with capture groups (e.g., `$1`, `$2`)
  - Batch replace now correctly expands capture groups instead of replacing with literal `$1`
  - Conversion between JavaScript-style (`$1`) and Python-style (`\1`) backreferences
  - Regular search & replace in main window continues to work as before

  - Fixed index mismatch between grouped rendering and selection logic
- **Regex library auto-scroll** - Edit form now auto-scrolls to top when clicking edit button
  - Smooth scroll animation to bring edit form into view
  - No more manual scrolling needed after clicking the pencil icon

### Changed
- **Batch check button clarity** - Renamed "Replace Selected" to "Replace All"
  - Button now accurately reflects that it applies all fixes from the profile
  - Removed confusing selection count from button text
  - Updated tooltip to explain functionality
- **Backup file location** - Backups now saved next to original file instead of in hidden folder

  - Easier to find and manage backups
  - Old `.backups` folder format still supported for backwards compatibility

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Dual search functionality** - Search in both source and target simultaneously with separate patterns
  - When "Both" is selected, two search fields appear (one for source, one for target)
  - Results show only segments where BOTH patterns match (AND logic)
  - Perfect for quality checks: find segments where source contains X but target doesn't contain Y
  - Use cases:
    - Product names: Source has "PRODUCTNAME", target missing it: `^((?!PRODUCTNAME).)*$`
    - Terminology validation: Source has "software", target doesn't have "programvare"
    - Variable consistency: Both source and target must contain `{count}`
    - Missing translations: Source non-empty, target empty
  - Works with regex, case sensitivity, live search, and tag protection
  - Each field has independent regex validation

### Improved
- **ICU auto-fix functionality** - Significant improvements to automatic error correction
  - Fix button now works correctly for segments with multiple ICU errors
  - Fixes apply immediately to the editor without needing to close/reopen the segment
  - ICU keyword fixes (e.g., "flertall" → "plural") now work even when variable names differ between source and target
  - All Fix buttons are now consistently aligned in the error list
  - Preview of what each fix will do is shown below the Fix button

### Fixed
- **Batch replace dialog issues** - Fixed confirm dialog not closing properly
  - Replaced browser `confirm()` and `alert()` with Tauri native dialogs
  - Dialogs now close correctly when clicking OK or Cancel
  - Better UX with native OS dialogs including titles and icons
  - Applied to batch replace confirmation and ICU auto-fix notifications

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **Automatic ICU error correction** - One-click fix for common ICU syntax errors
  - Fix button appears next to each ICU error that can be auto-corrected
  - Automatically corrects ICU keywords (e.g., "flertall" → "plural", "velg" → "select")
  - Automatically corrects category keywords (e.g., "en" → "one", "andre" → "other")
  - Automatically adds missing braces ({ or })
  - Automatically inserts missing "offset:" in plural expressions
  - Supports Norwegian and other common translations of ICU keywords

### Changed
- Renamed all "QA" terminology to "Batch Checks" for clarity
  - "QA Profiles" → "Batch Check Profiles"
  - "QA Batch Checks" → "Batch Checks"
  - Menu items and UI text updated throughout the application
- Updated menu shortcut label (Cmd+P) to "Batch Check Profiles"

- All form labels now properly associated with their inputs
- Focus indicators now meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (2px solid outline)
